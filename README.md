# Crypto Clustering Project
In this challenge, I used my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Applying the K-means algorithm to identify the clusters in a dataset.
- Determining the optimal number of clusters for a dataset by using the elbow method.
- Normalizing data by using the StandardScaler module from scikit-learn.
- Using PCA to reduce the number of features in an unsupervised learning setting.
- Explaining how reducing the number of features affects the resulting clusters vs using all features.
- Creating and manipulating DataFrames using the Pandas module in Jupyter Notebook.
- Creating line graphs and scatterplots using hvplot.
- Coloring scatterplots by determined cluster and assigning hover text to show the name of the cryptocurrency.
